# Dumped-wifi-password-extractor
This script will help you to get the password of network interfaces you were connected once 
you just have to just type the ssid in the input dialogue and boom its key content will be displayed onto the next line 
I made this because the traditional way of getting it is little lenghty so I thought to automate and make the whole process  a little easier 
Working on a future project to store all the ssids and passwords in a txt file that will be out soon
